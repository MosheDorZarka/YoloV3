# YoloV3
End-to-end custom implementation of YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) using Keras3 for personal practice and deepening understanding in computer vision. This project is my exploration into the intricacies of real-time object detection, leveraging YOLOv3's robust architecture with the flexibility and power of Keras3.
